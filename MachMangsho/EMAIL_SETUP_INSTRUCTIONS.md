# Instructions for Vercel Backend Environment Variables

You need to add these environment variables to your Vercel backend project:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your backend project (server)
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add these variables:

EMAIL_FROM = machmangsho2025@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD = pnceqyggatmggbeh

## IMPORTANT: Update Logo URL

In `server/utils/email.js`, update the logo URL:
```javascript
const logoUrl = "https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app/logo2.jpg";
```
Replace `your-frontend-domain.vercel.app` with your actual frontend Vercel domain.

Example: `https://mach-mangsho.vercel.app/logo2.jpg`

**Alternative:** For immediate testing, the current placeholder logo will show "MachMangsho" text.
To use your actual logo, upload it to a CDN or use your deployed frontend URL.

Important Notes:
- The app password should be entered without spaces (remove spaces between letters)
- Make sure NODE_ENV is set to "production" in Vercel for proper cookie handling
- Redeploy your backend after adding these environment variables
- Update the logo URL with your actual frontend domain

## Test the Email System:

1. Place a COD order on your website
2. Place a Stripe order on your website  
3. Check the server logs for email success/failure messages
4. Verify emails are received in the user's inbox

## Troubleshooting:

- Check server logs for "Email server connection verified successfully" on startup
- If emails aren't sending, verify the app password is correct and doesn't have spaces
- Gmail may block the first few emails - check spam folder
- For production, consider using a dedicated email service like SendGrid or Resend
